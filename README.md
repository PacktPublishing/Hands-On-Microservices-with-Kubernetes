**Build, deploy, and manage scalable microservices on Kubernetes**

## What is this book about?
Kubernetes is among the most popular open-source platforms for automating the deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts, providing a container-centric infrastructure.


This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the synergy between Kubernetes and microservices 
* Create a complete CI/CD pipeline for your microservices on Kubernetes 
* Develop microservices on Kubernetes with the Go kit framework using best practices 
* Manage and monitor your system using Kubernetes and open-source tools 
* Expose your services through REST and gRPC APIs 
* Implement and deploy serverless functions as a service 
* Externalize authentication, authorization and traffic shaping using a service mesh 
* Run a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud on Google Kubernetes Engine

    - image: circleci/postgres:9.6-alpine
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for developers, DevOps engineers, or anyone who wants to develop large-scale microservice-based systems on top of Kubernetes. If you are looking to use Kubernetes on live production projects or want to migrate existing systems to a modern containerized microservices system, then this book is for you. Coding skills, together with some knowledge of Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud concepts will be useful.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-).
* Docker
* Kubectl
* Minikube
* Go
* CircleCI and Argo CD
* Delinkcious
* GKE
