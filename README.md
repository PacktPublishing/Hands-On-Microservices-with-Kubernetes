This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the synergy between Kubernetes and microservices 
* Create a complete CI/CD pipeline for your microservices on Kubernetes 
* Develop microservices on Kubernetes with the Go kit framework using best practices 
* Manage and monitor your system using Kubernetes and open-source tools 
* Expose your services through REST and gRPC APIs 
* Implement and deploy serverless functions as a service 
* Externalize authentication, authorization and traffic shaping using a service mesh 
* Run a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud on Google Kubernetes Engine
